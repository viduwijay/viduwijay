### 💡 About Me

Hi, I’m **Vidushani Wijayananda**, but online I go by **Vidu Wijay** — a short, memorable name that reflects my indie developer identity.

My journey into code began in the most unexpected way — a random person introduced me to programming, and it completely shifted my path. I spent nearly **2 years just dreaming** about being a developer... until **2025**, when I finally started learning seriously.

Since then, I've been exploring everything I love in tech — from **front-end development** to **AI** and **3D design** — and I’ve absolutely **fallen in love with building and problem solving**.

Now, I’m:
- 🧠 Learning deeply and slowly
- 🚀 Building in public
- 🎯 Planning to launch my first **digital product** soon
